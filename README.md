## Background
At the Marlborough Chamber of Commerce, the Office Manager is responsible for a variety of tasks across several areas of responsibility, including office operations, finance, marketing, IT, and more. The Task Scope Checker was developed to help ensure that tasks are properly assigned to the correct person based on their area of responsibility.

The tool works by allowing users to input a brief description of the task they need help with. The system then checks the task against a list of keywords associated with various areas of responsibility, and provides the user with guidance on which area of responsibility the task may fall under. If the task falls within the Office Manager's scope of responsibility, the user is prompted to provide additional details about the task.

## Installation
To install the Task Scope Checker, simply download the files and place them in a directory on your web server. There are no additional dependencies or setup required.

## Usage
To use the Task Scope Checker, simply navigate to the URL where the tool is installed, and enter a brief description of the task you need help with. The system will automatically check the task against a list of keywords associated with various areas of responsibility, and provide guidance on which area of responsibility the task may fall under.

If the task falls within the Office Manager's scope of responsibility, the user will be prompted to provide additional details about the task, including the requester's name, priority level, due date, and specific instructions. Once the details are entered, the system will automatically generate an email to the appropriate person with all the necessary information.
